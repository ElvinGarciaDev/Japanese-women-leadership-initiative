## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS

This layout was created with Flexbox and I used REM to make it responsive.

## Lessons Learned:

REM is relative to the html font-size. it's a good idea to make the html font-size: 62.5% so we can calculate pixels easier.
html { font-size: 62.5%; } /* =10px */
